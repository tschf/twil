# This week I learned

What is this repository about? This is a scratch pad so to speak of topics I'm reading about/learning and serves as a motivation to promoto continuous learning, and by writing it down I hope it to be a place I can reflect on in the future, should I need a refresher. Please feel free to correct me on any errors you notice via a PR.
